[{"content":"\u0026ldquo;High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules. Both should depend on abstractions.\u0026rdquo;\nWelcome to a core principle of software architecture: Dependency Inversion, the \u0026ldquo;D\u0026rdquo; in SOLID. In this article, we’ll explore what it means in practice, how to implement it in Go using interfaces and dependency injection, and why it’s essential for writing unit-testable code.\n🧠 What Is the Dependency Inversion Principle? The Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP) flips the traditional dependency model:\n❌ Traditional: High-level business logic depends directly on low-level implementation (e.g., a database).\n✅ DIP: Both layers depend on abstractions — usually in the form of interfaces.\nIt’s about reversing the direction of dependency to reduce coupling and improve flexibility.\n💡 A Quick Example: Tightly Coupled Code 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 type OrderService struct { db *sql.DB } func (o *OrderService) Save(order Order) error { _, err := o.db.Exec(\u0026#34;INSERT INTO orders ...\u0026#34;) return err } This code:\nTightly couples OrderService to a concrete *sql.DB\nIs hard to test in isolation\n✅ Refactor with Dependency Inversion Let’s invert the dependency:\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 type OrderRepository interface { Save(order Order) error } type OrderService struct { repo OrderRepository } func (o *OrderService) Save(order Order) error { return o.repo.Save(order) } Now:\nOrderService depends on an interface\nOrderRepository can be backed by a real DB in prod or a mock in tests\n🛠️ Enter Dependency Injection We’ve inverted dependencies — now we need a way to supply them. Manual constructor injection in Go:\n1 2 3 func NewOrderService(repo OrderRepository) *OrderService { return \u0026amp;OrderService{repo: repo} } At runtime, inject the actual implementation:\n1 service := NewOrderService(NewPostgresOrderRepository(db)) 🧪 Why This Rocks for Testing DIP + interfaces = test-friendly code.\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 type MockOrderRepository struct { SavedOrder Order } func (m *MockOrderRepository) Save(order Order) error { m.SavedOrder = order return nil } func TestOrderService_Save(t *testing.T) { mock := \u0026amp;MockOrderRepository{} service := NewOrderService(mock) order := Order{ID: 42} err := service.Save(order) require.NoError(t, err) require.Equal(t, 42, mock.SavedOrder.ID) } You’ve isolated business logic from infrastructure — the holy grail of testability.\n🔄 Summary DIP inverts traditional dependency direction: high-level modules depend on interfaces, not implementations.\nInterfaces define contracts at the boundaries.\nDependency Injection supplies those interfaces at runtime.\nUnit Testing becomes effortless when your logic isn’t tangled up in database, network, or file system concerns.\n🧭 When to Use DIP in Go ✅ When abstracting IO, storage, APIs, or 3rd party integrations\n✅ When writing business logic you want to test independently\n❌ Not needed for everything — Go prefers concrete, simple code unless you need indirection\n","permalink":"https://norbix.dev/posts/dependency-inversion-principle/","summary":"A deep dive into the Dependency Inversion Principle, its implementation with interfaces and dependency injection, and how it unlocks clean, testable Go code.","title":"Breaking the Chain: Dependency Inversion, Interfaces, and Testable Go Code"},{"content":"The whiteboard behind this article is more than just colorful notes — it\u0026rsquo;s a map of the mental models that drive clean, scalable, and maintainable software systems.

Writing Go code that lasts? That takes practice.\nAfter working on production systems in Go for several years — across SaaS platforms, cloud-native backends, and developer tooling — I’ve collected a set of battle-tested best practices that have helped me write maintainable, clean, and scalable Go code.\n🧭 0. Agree on Code Style Before You Write a Line Before starting any development, align on a shared code style with your team.\nThis prevents unnecessary friction during code reviews, ensures consistency, and reduces the mental overhead of switching between files written by different developers.\nA great starting point is the Google Go Style Guide — it\u0026rsquo;s clear, opinionated, and battle-tested at scale. You can automate style enforcement with:\ngofmt / goimports for formatting golangci-lint to enforce idiomatic Go practices Establishing your code style early also makes onboarding faster and simplifies collaboration — especially in cross-functional teams or open source projects.\n✅ 1. Keep it Simple Go is intentionally minimal — embrace it.\nAvoid over-engineering. Prefer composition over inheritance. Use plain interfaces and simple data structures. Don’t abstract too early — write the concrete code first. 🧱 2. Project Structure Matters Use a predictable layout:\n1 2 3 4 5 6 /cmd - entry points /internal - private packages /pkg - public, reusable packages /api - OpenAPI/proto definitions /config - config loading /scripts - helper scripts Stick to convention. Tools like golang-standards/project-layout are a great starting point — but adapt it to your team’s needs.\n🧪 3. Tests Are Not Optional Use table-driven tests Use testing, and only bring in libraries like testify if you really need them Keep unit tests fast and independent Use go test -cover to check coverage ✨ 4. Errors Are First-Class Citizens Always check errors — no exceptions. Wrap errors with context using fmt.Errorf(\u0026quot;failed to read config: %w\u0026quot;, err) For complex systems, consider using errors.Join or errors.Is/As for proper error handling. 📦 5. Use Interfaces at the Boundaries Keep interfaces small, and only expose them where needed:\n1 2 3 type Storer interface { Save(ctx context.Context, data Item) error } Don’t write interfaces for everything — only where mocking or substitution matters (e.g. storage, HTTP clients, etc.).\n🧰 6. Tooling Makes You Better Use go vet, staticcheck, and golangci-lint Automate formatting: gofmt, goimports Use go mod tidy to keep your dependencies clean Pin tool versions with a tools.go file 🔐 7. Secure By Default Always set timeouts on HTTP clients and servers Avoid leaking secrets in logs Validate all inputs — especially on the API boundary Use context.Context consistently and propagate it properly 🌐 8. Embrace the Go Ecosystem Use standard library wherever possible — it\u0026rsquo;s well-tested and fast Prefer established, well-maintained packages Read source code — Go makes it easy to learn from the best 🚀 9. Performance Matters (but correctness first) Profile with pprof Avoid allocations in tight loops Use channels, but don’t abuse goroutines Benchmark with go test -bench 🧠 10. Readability \u0026gt; Cleverness Your code will be read 10x more than it’s written.\n\u0026quot;Write code for humans, not machines.\u0026quot; Stick to idiomatic Go — use golangci-lint to enforce consistency, and always code with your teammates in mind.\n🙌 Conclusion Go is an incredible tool for building fast, reliable software — but like any tool, it shines brightest in the hands of developers who respect its philosophy: clarity, simplicity, and composability.\nWhat are your favorite Go best practices?
