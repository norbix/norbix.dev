Edgar H. Schein, in his book Humble Consulting, challenges the traditional model of the “all-knowing expert.”\nInstead of delivering answers from a pedestal, humble consulting emphasizes:\nBeing genuinely curious about the client’s context Listening without judgment Building trust step by step Exploring adaptive solutions together This approach turns the consultant into a partner, not just a vendor.\n💡 Why It Matters for Software \u0026 B2B Engineering In software projects, the biggest risks rarely come from technical complexity—they come from misalignment, assumptions, and poor communication.\nHumble consulting addresses these by:\n🤝 Faster trust-building → clients share the real issues early, reducing rework costs. 🎯 Better solutions → co-created designs mean fewer failed features and less waste. 🚀 Reduced risks \u0026 delays → solving the right problem avoids budget overruns. For B2B engineering and SaaS, this translates directly into financial value.\n🔑 Gatekeepers: The Hidden Connectors In every organization there are gatekeepers—people who are not always visible but hold direct influence with decision-makers.\nThey may be senior engineers, trusted managers, or long-tenured staff who quietly shape what leaders approve.\nHere’s the challenge: traditional “hard-selling” approaches often miss them.\nBut humble consulting naturally surfaces gatekeepers because:\nYou listen deeply instead of pitching. You build trust at multiple levels, not just with the C-suite. You co-create solutions, which encourages gatekeepers to reveal what really matters. Once you have a gatekeeper’s trust, your ability to sell services, ideas, or products skyrockets. Why?\nBecause you’re no longer just “another vendor”—you’ve earned the support of someone who whispers in the decision-maker’s ear.\n📈 The Business Value in Money Terms At its core, business value means one thing: earning more or saving more.\nHumble consulting helps companies do both:\n💰 Earn More Revenue\nBy uncovering opportunities through gatekeepers that outsiders would never see. By delivering solutions that stakeholders actually adopt and pay for. By strengthening relationships that lead to renewals and upsells. 💰 Save More Money\nBy avoiding months of wasted development on the wrong features. By reducing project delays (which directly cut into margins). By minimizing risk of failed rollouts or expensive rework. Every hour spent listening with humility can save weeks of rework.\nEvery gatekeeper won over can unlock hidden revenue streams.\nWhat is Money Language? It is a language of the executives and decision-makers who control budgets.\nMore can be found under this fantastic podcast with Pini Reznik: The Rise of Cloud Native\n🔍 How to Apply Humble Consulting in Tech Projects Start with curiosity, not expertise\nAsk open questions: “What’s the business impact behind this request?” Avoid jumping into “solution mode” too early. Observe without judgment\nStakeholders and gatekeepers often know the hidden cost drivers. By listening, you surface inefficiencies that can be fixed. Co-create instead of dictating\nJoint workshops, prototypes, and iterations create alignment. Shared ownership ensures solutions stick (and ROI is realized). Personalize your approach\nEach company’s culture and financial drivers are different—tailor accordingly. 🚀 Closing Thoughts The most effective consultants and engineers aren’t the ones who talk the most—they’re the ones who listen, adapt, and connect with decision-makers and their trusted gatekeepers.\nHumble consulting is not just about being nice—it’s about unlocking influence, protecting budgets, accelerating revenue, and maximizing ROI.\n👉 In other words: humility pays—especially when it helps you reach the gatekeepers who hold the keys to business growth.\n🚀 Follow me on norbix.dev for more insights on Go, Python, AI, system design, and engineering wisdom.\n","wordCount":"571","inLanguage":"en","datePublished":"2025-09-17T10:00:00+02:00","dateModified":"2025-09-17T10:00:00+02:00","mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://norbix.dev/posts/humble-consulting/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"norbix.dev - The log of my journey through code \u0026 software systems architecture","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://norbix.dev/favicon.ico"}}}</script></head><body><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"&&document.body.classList.remove("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://norbix.dev/ accesskey=h title="norbix.dev - The log of my journey through code & software systems architecture (Alt + H)">norbix.dev - The log of my journey through code & software systems architecture</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://norbix.dev/ title=Home><span>Home</span></a></li><li><a href=https://norbix.dev/posts/ title=Posts><span>Posts</span></a></li><li><a href=https://norbix.dev/tags/ title=Tags><span>Tags</span></a></li><li><a href=https://norbix.dev/about/ title=About><span>About</span></a></li><li><a href=https://norbix.dev/index.xml title="📡 RSS"><span>📡 RSS</span></a></li></ul></nav></header><main><main id=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><h1 class=post-title>Humble Consulting: How Curiosity Creates Real Business Value</h1><span title='2025-09-17 10:00:00 +0200 +0200'>September 17, 2025</span></header><div class=post-content><nav class=table-of-contents><nav id=TableOfContents><ul><li><a href=#-what-is-humble-consulting>🌱 What Is Humble Consulting?</a></li><li><a href=#-why-it-matters-for-software--b2b-engineering>💡 Why It Matters for Software & B2B Engineering</a></li><li><a href=#-gatekeepers-the-hidden-connectors>🔑 Gatekeepers: The Hidden Connectors</a></li><li><a href=#-the-business-value-in-money-terms>📈 The Business Value in Money Terms</a></li><li><a href=#what-is-money-language>What is <code>Money Language</code>?</a></li><li><a href=#-how-to-apply-humble-consulting-in-tech-projects>🔍 How to Apply Humble Consulting in Tech Projects</a></li><li><a href=#-closing-thoughts>🚀 Closing Thoughts</a></li></ul></nav></nav><p><img loading=lazy src=humble_consulting.png alt="Humble Consulting"></p><hr><h2 id=-what-is-humble-consulting>🌱 What Is Humble Consulting?</h2><p>Edgar H.
