They enable it.”\nYou’ve probably heard the term Platform Engineering thrown around. But is it just rebranded DevOps? Is it SRE with a cooler name? Or cloud automation with some swagger?\nLet’s set the record straight — and show why platform engineering is becoming the backbone of modern engineering organizations.\n🚀 What Is Platform Engineering? Platform Engineering is the discipline of designing, building, and maintaining internal platforms that streamline and scale software delivery. It brings together principles from DevOps, SRE, and cloud engineering into a cohesive, developer-friendly toolkit.\nThink of it as building “paved roads” that teams can confidently deploy on — without needing to reinvent infrastructure, pipelines, or observability every time.\nThe end goal? Enable dev teams to ship faster and safer — without needing to be Kubernetes, Terraform, or AWS experts.\n🧱 What Goes Into a Platform? Platform engineers often build and maintain:\n🏗️ Internal Developer Platforms (IDPs): Self-service interfaces and APIs for provisioning, deploying, and managing services e.g. container8.io.\n🔁 CI/CD Pipelines: Standardized, reusable workflows for testing and deploying code.\n☁️ Infrastructure as Code (IaC): Terraform, Pulumi, Crossplane, etc.\n🔍 Observability Tools: Centralized logging, metrics, and tracing integrations.\n🔒 Security and Compliance Controls: Guardrails, not roadblocks.\n🧩 How It Relates to DevOps, SRE, and Cloud DevOps ✅ DevOps is a culture of collaboration and automation.\nPlatform engineering productizes DevOps by building internal tools and workflows that developers can actually use.\nSRE ✅ SRE focuses on reliability, automation, and incident response.\nPlatform teams embed SRE principles into the platform: error budgets, golden signals, runbooks.\nCloud Engineering ✅ Cloud engineering provides the infrastructure foundation.\nPlatform engineers abstract that complexity into reusable modules and templates.\nAWS Networking Platform Engineering = DevOps + SRE + Cloud + DX (Developer Experience)\n🧠 Why Platform Engineering Matters In complex environments — multiple teams, microservices, polyglot stacks — platform engineering provides:\n🔄 Consistency: Standardized pipelines and infra reduce cognitive load.\n🧪 Safety: Guardrails prevent footguns and accelerate onboarding.\n🛠️ Developer Enablement: Engineers focus on features, not YAML.\n⚖️ Scalability: Platforms scale better than hero engineers.\nGreat platform teams act like product teams: listen to users, iterate fast, and deliver value continuously.\n🧭 From DevOps to Platform Engineering As organizations mature, their engineering practices evolve across several stages — from ad-hoc processes to fully autonomous, AI-driven ecosystems.\nThis chart illustrates the evolutionary path of software delivery maturity, showing how teams move through stages of:\nCulture — from individualistic to collaborative to experimental\nArchitecture — from monoliths to microservices to functions\nInfrastructure — from manual servers to orchestrated containers to edge computing\nProcess \u0026 Delivery — from random releases to continuous delivery to continuous deployment\nPlatform engineering typically thrives at the Cloud Native stage — where DevOps, SRE, and developer experience converge.\nAt this point, teams have:\nAutomated provisioning (Kubernetes, Terraform, GitOps)\nContinuous delivery pipelines\nFull observability and self-healing systems\nData-driven decision-making across infrastructure and product layers\nThe next frontier (NEXT) is where platforms become intelligent: predictive maintenance, AI-driven ops, and self-organizing teams. Platform engineers will lead this transition by combining automation with machine learning and proactive governance.\n🌍 The 6 R’s of Cloud Migration Platform engineering often intersects with cloud migration strategies. When modernizing workloads, organizations typically choose from the 6 R’s framework:\nRehost (Lift and Shift) → Move applications “as-is” into the cloud. Fast but not cloud-optimized. Replatform (Lift, Tinker, and Shift) → Minor tweaks for optimization (e.g., managed DBs, autoscaling). Refactor → Fully re-architect to leverage cloud-native design (microservices, serverless). Repurchase → Replace with SaaS solutions (e.g., Salesforce, Workday). Retire → Decommission redundant applications. Retain → Keep some workloads on-prem due to compliance or cost. 👉 Platform teams help organizations navigate the 6 R’s by providing reusable infrastructure, migration tooling, and golden paths. Instead of one-off migrations, they turn cloud adoption into a repeatable, scalable process.\n🛤️ Golden Paths: The Secret Sauce Platform engineering isn’t just about tools — it’s about opinionated defaults. The best platforms offer “golden paths”:\nRecommended ways to build, test, and deploy apps\nTemplates for services, jobs, infrastructure\nStandardized observability and alerting\nGive devs superpowers — not blank canvases.\n📦 Tools of the Trade Some common tools and patterns used by platform teams:\nIaC: Terraform, Pulumi, CDK\nCI/CD: GitHub Actions, ArgoCD, Tekton, Spinnaker\nContainers \u0026 K8s: Helm, Crossplane, Kubernetes Operators\nDeveloper Portals: Backstage, Port, Humanitec\nObservability: Prometheus, Grafana, OpenTelemetry\n💬 Final Thoughts Platform Engineering is not a fad. It’s a response to real-world complexity at scale. As orgs grow, they need paved roads, not paved-over tickets.\nThe future of software delivery is internal platforms that combine speed, reliability, and safety — all with a developer-first mindset.\n🚀 Follow me on norbix.dev for more insights on Go, Python, AI, system design, and engineering wisdom.\n","wordCount":"789","inLanguage":"en","datePublished":"2025-04-22T16:00:00+02:00","dateModified":"2025-04-22T16:00:00+02:00","mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://norbix.dev/posts/platform-engineering/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"norbix.dev - The log of my journey through code \u0026 software systems architecture","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://norbix.dev/favicon.ico"}}}</script></head><body><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"&&document.body.classList.remove("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://norbix.dev/ accesskey=h title="norbix.dev - The log of my journey through code & software systems architecture (Alt + H)">norbix.dev - The log of my journey through code & software systems architecture</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://norbix.dev/ title=Home><span>Home</span></a></li><li><a href=https://norbix.dev/posts/ title=Posts><span>Posts</span></a></li><li><a href=https://norbix.dev/tags/ title=Tags><span>Tags</span></a></li><li><a href=https://norbix.dev/about/ title=About><span>About</span></a></li><li><a href=https://norbix.dev/index.xml title="📡 RSS"><span>📡 RSS</span></a></li></ul></nav></header><main><main id=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><h1 class=post-title>Platform Engineering: The DevOps You Productize</h1><span title='2025-04-22 16:00:00 +0200 +0200'>April 22, 2025</span></header><div class=post-content><nav class=table-of-contents><nav id=TableOfContents><ol><li><a href=#-what-is-platform-engineering>🚀 What Is Platform Engineering?</a></li><li><a href=#-what-goes-into-a-platform>🧱 What Goes Into a Platform?</a></li><li><a href=#-how-it-relates-to-devops-sre-and-cloud>🧩 How It Relates to DevOps, SRE, and Cloud</a><ol><li><a href=#devops->DevOps ✅</a></li><li><a href=#sre->SRE ✅</a></li><li><a href=#cloud-engineering->Cloud Engineering ✅</a><ol><li><a href=#aws-networking>AWS Networking</a></li></ol></li></ol></li><li><a href=#-why-platform-engineering-matters>🧠 Why Platform Engineering Matters</a></li><li><a href=#-from-devops-to-platform-engineering>🧭 From DevOps to Platform Engineering</a></li><li><a href=#-the-6-rs-of-cloud-migration>🌍 The 6 R’s of Cloud Migration</a></li><li><a href=#-golden-paths-the-secret-sauce>🛤️ Golden Paths: The Secret Sauce</a></li><li><a href=#-tools-of-the-trade>📦 Tools of the Trade</a></li><li><a href=#-final-thoughts>💬 Final Thoughts</a></li></ol></nav></nav><p><img loading=lazy src=banner.jpg alt=banner></p><p><strong>&ldquo;Great platforms don’t abstract power.
