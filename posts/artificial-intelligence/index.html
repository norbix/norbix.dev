It‚Äôs about amplifying human potential.‚Äù\nArtificial Intelligence (AI) is one of the most transformative forces in technology today. From recommendation engines on Netflix to self-driving cars and generative models like ChatGPT, AI is shaping how we work, live, and create.\nBut AI is often misunderstood. Is it the same as machine learning? Where does deep learning fit? Let‚Äôs break it down.\nüß† Artificial Intelligence: The Big Picture Artificial Intelligence (AI) is the broad field focused on creating systems that mimic human intelligence.\nExamples include:\nRule-based systems (e.g., chess engines from the 1980s) Natural language processing (chatbots, translators) Computer vision (face recognition, object detection) Robotics and autonomous systems AI doesn‚Äôt always require learning. A simple rule-based expert system is AI, even if it doesn‚Äôt adapt over time.\nüîπ Tip: Think of AI as the goal ‚Äî making machines ‚Äúsmart.‚Äù\nü§î How ChatGPT Works Behind the Scenes One of today‚Äôs most visible applications of AI is ChatGPT, a large language model built using deep learning. Here‚Äôs how it works at a high level:\nTraining on huge datasets\nChatGPT is trained on text from books, articles, code, and the web. During training, it learns statistical patterns in language: which words are likely to follow others. Neural network architecture\nIt uses a Transformer neural network, which is designed to understand context by attending to relationships between words in a sentence (or across multiple sentences). Instead of reading text word by word, Transformers look at the entire sequence and assign attention weights to important words. Token prediction\nChatGPT doesn‚Äôt ‚Äúknow‚Äù facts. It predicts the most likely next word (token) given the conversation so far. By chaining these predictions together, it generates coherent sentences and paragraphs. Fine-tuning \u0026 reinforcement learning\nAfter pretraining, models like ChatGPT are fine-tuned on curated datasets. With Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF), human reviewers rank responses, teaching the model to prefer helpful and safe answers. Inference (what you see as a user)\nWhen you type a question, the model converts your text into tokens, processes them through billions of neural connections, and outputs the most probable sequence of tokens as a reply. This happens in real time, often within a fraction of a second. üîπ Tip: ChatGPT doesn‚Äôt ‚Äúthink‚Äù or ‚Äúunderstand‚Äù in a human sense ‚Äî it‚Äôs a pattern recognition engine predicting the next best word based on prior data.\nOther AI Models Competing with ChatGPT While ChatGPT remains dominant, a diverse and growing array of AI models now compete globally‚Äîeach offering unique strengths depending on your needs.\nClaude (by Anthropic) Claude is known for its human-like interactions and long context handling. Its latest versions (Claude 3 series: Haiku, Sonnet, Opus; as well as Claude 4.1) are optimized for reasoning, coding, and complex logic.:contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1} Google Gemini A multimodal LLM capable of processing text, images, audio, and video within the same context.

Choose based on task, ecosystem, and your control preferences\nüìä Machine Learning: Learning from Data Machine Learning (ML) is a subset of AI. Instead of hard-coding rules, ML algorithms learn from data and improve as they‚Äôre exposed to more examples.\nCommon ML applications:\nEmail spam filters Predictive maintenance in manufacturing Fraud detection in finance Recommendation engines (Amazon, Netflix) ML techniques include regression, decision trees, clustering, and reinforcement learning.\nüîπ Tip: ML is the toolbox that powers much of modern AI.\nü§ñ Deep Learning: The Neural Revolution Deep Learning (DL) is a specialized branch of ML that uses artificial neural networks with many layers (hence ‚Äúdeep‚Äù).\nDL shines in tasks where large amounts of unstructured data are available:\nImage classification (e.g., Google Photos) Speech recognition (e.g., Siri, Alexa) Large language models (e.g., ChatGPT, GPT-5) DL requires significant computational power and data, but it has unlocked breakthroughs that traditional ML couldn‚Äôt achieve.\nüîπ Tip: Deep learning is why AI feels ‚Äúmagical‚Äù today.\n‚öñÔ∏è AI vs. ML vs. DL: A Mental Model Think of it as nested circles:\nAI = the broadest circle (the goal: intelligent machines) ML = inside AI (the approach: learning from data) DL = inside ML (the breakthrough technique: neural networks) Not all AI is ML, and not all ML is deep learning.\nüöÄ Real-World Impact AI is no longer futuristic ‚Äî it‚Äôs in your pocket and in your workflows:\nHealthcare: AI helps detect diseases in scans earlier than humans. Finance: AI models predict stock trends and detect anomalies. Transportation: Self-driving cars rely on deep learning for vision and navigation. Software engineering: AI assists in code generation, testing, and DevOps automation. üîπ Tip: Learn to spot where AI can bring efficiency, not just where it‚Äôs trendy.\nüîÑ Wrapping Up AI, ML, and DL are often used interchangeably, but they represent different layers of abstraction:\nAI: The vision (intelligent machines) ML: The method (learning from data) DL: The breakthrough (neural networks at scale) Understanding these differences will help you cut through the hype and build systems that leverage AI in practical, impactful ways.\nüöÄ Follow me on norbix.dev for more insights on Go, Python, AI, system design, and engineering wisdom.\n","wordCount":"1223","inLanguage":"en","datePublished":"2025-09-04T18:00:00+02:00","dateModified":"2025-09-04T18:00:00+02:00","mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://norbix.dev/posts/artificial-intelligence/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"norbix.dev - The log of my journey through code \u0026 software systems architecture","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://norbix.dev/favicon.ico"}}}</script></head><body><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"&&document.body.classList.remove("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://norbix.dev/ accesskey=h title="norbix.dev - The log of my journey through code & software systems architecture (Alt + H)">norbix.dev - The log of my journey through code & software systems architecture</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://norbix.dev/ title=Home><span>Home</span></a></li><li><a href=https://norbix.dev/posts/ title=Posts><span>Posts</span></a></li><li><a href=https://norbix.dev/tags/ title=Tags><span>Tags</span></a></li><li><a href=https://norbix.dev/about/ title=About><span>About</span></a></li><li><a href=https://norbix.dev/index.xml title="üì° RSS"><span>üì° RSS</span></a></li></ul></nav></header><main><main id=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><h1 class=post-title>Demystifying Artificial Intelligence: AI, Machine Learning, and Deep Learning</h1><span title='2025-09-04 18:00:00 +0200 +0200'>September 4, 2025</span></header><div class=post-content><nav class=table-of-contents><nav id=TableOfContents><ul><li><a href=#-artificial-intelligence-the-big-picture>üß† Artificial Intelligence: The Big Picture</a><ul><li><a href=#-how-chatgpt-works-behind-the-scenes>ü§î How ChatGPT Works Behind the Scenes</a></li><li><a href=#other-ai-models-competing-with-chatgpt>Other AI Models Competing with ChatGPT</a></li><li><a href=#quick-comparison-table>Quick Comparison Table</a></li></ul></li><li><a href=#-machine-learning-learning-from-data>üìä Machine Learning: Learning from Data</a></li><li><a href=#-deep-learning-the-neural-revolution>ü§ñ Deep Learning: The Neural Revolution</a></li><li><a href=#-ai-vs-ml-vs-dl-a-mental-model>‚öñÔ∏è AI vs. ML vs. DL: A Mental Model</a></li><li><a href=#-real-world-impact>üöÄ Real-World Impact</a></li><li><a href=#-wrapping-up>üîÑ Wrapping Up</a></li></ul></nav></nav><p><img loading=lazy src=banner.jpg alt=banner></p><p><strong>&ldquo;Artificial Intelligence isn‚Äôt about replacing humans.
