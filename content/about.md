Hi, I'm **Norbert Jakubczak** — aka **Norbix** 👋

I'm a polyglot **Software Engineer** with a strong focus on **Golang** and **Python**, working across the full stack — from backend and cloud infrastructure to frontend integration and developer tooling.

I specialize in building **Internal Developer Platforms (IDPs)** and architecting scalable **Software-as-a-Service (SaaS)** systems using microservices and modern cloud-native technologies.

Before stepping fully into tech, I was a **professional basketball player** — a path that taught me discipline, team dynamics, and what it means to perform under pressure. That mindset still drives how I build software today.
