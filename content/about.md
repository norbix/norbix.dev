Hi, I'm **Norbert Jakubczak** — aka **Norbix** 👋

    Welcome to my tech blog — where code, systems thinking, and engineering mindset meet. 🚀
  </figcaption>

I'm a polyglot **Software Engineer** with a strong focus on **Golang** and **Python**, working across the full stack — from backend and cloud infrastructure to frontend integration and developer tooling.

I specialize in building **Internal Developer Platforms (IDPs)** and architecting scalable **Software-as-a-Service (SaaS)** systems using microservices and modern cloud-native technologies.

Before stepping fully into tech, I was a **professional basketball player** — a path that taught me discipline, team dynamics, and what it means to perform under pressure. That mindset still drives how I build software today.

    Building norbix.dev — Behind the Scenes.
  </figcaption>
</figure>

The **norbix.dev** blog is built with the same engineering discipline I apply to software projects — modular, automated, and reproducible.

- **Static site generator:** [Hugo](https://gohugo.io) + [PaperMod](https://github.com/adityatelange/hugo-PaperMod) theme
- **Content:** Markdown files version-controlled in `Git`
- **Automation:** Built and deployed automatically via **GitHub Actions**
- **Infrastructure:** Hosted on a lightweight, container-friendly stack (Nginx reverse proxy in the future)
- **Versioning:** Each article is treated like a code change — reviewed, versioned, and deployed continuously

💡 *This blog isn’t just written about engineering — it’s engineered itself.*
